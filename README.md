## Exploration and ameliorations of HMM algorithms

- [x] 1st order HMM
- [x] 2nd order HMM
- [x] Expand model to noisy characters insertions
- [x] Expand model to noisy characters deletions
- [x] Unsupervised training (EM) for HMM1

- [x] Initialization of matrices with simple uniform probablility distribution (~ Laplace smoothing)
- [x] More complex smoothing for proba estimations for HMM2

- [x] Acceleration of Viterbi algorithm with numpy broadcasting
- [x] Change floating point numbers precision in case of large states or observations sets
- [x] Use log-probabilities
